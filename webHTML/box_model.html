    <p>The Milky Way or Milky Way Galaxy[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the
        galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars in other arms of
        the galaxy, which are so far away that they cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The Milky Way
        is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600
        light-years),[10] but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent
        simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of
        almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc).[28][29] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the
        Local Group of galaxies, forming part of the Virgo Supercluster which is itself a component of the Laniakea
        Supercluster. It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars[32][33] and at least that number of
        planets.[34][35] The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years (8.3 kpc) from the Galactic
        Center,[36] on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The
        stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The
        Galactic Center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034)
        million solar masses.[37][38] The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the universe itself and
        thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.
